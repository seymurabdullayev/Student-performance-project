# Student-Performance-Report
This project analyzes university students' performance using SQL and Power BI. It focuses on understanding attendance behavior, course loads, and student outcomes based on a relational database model.


## Project structure
1. [University_students.sql](./University_students.sql) - SQL file that builds and populates the database.
2. [University_students_model_view.mwb](./University_students_model_view.png) - MySQL schema diagram for database structure.
3. [Power BI Dashboards](./Power%20BI%20Dashboards/) - Visual representations of selected analytical queries.
4. [Questions results](./Questions%20results/) - CSV files generated from 12 SQL queries answering key business questions.
5. [Tables](./Tables/) - Contains 5 data tables used in the analysis ("students", "courses", "attendance", "grades" and "student_courses").


## Technologies used 
1. Mockaroo.com - Used to generate realistic sample data for some database tables.
2. Python - Used to script and generate synthetic datasets for analysis.
3. MySQL - Relational database design, query writing include joins, subqueries and grouping.
4. Power BI - Data visualisation and storytelling via interactive dashboards.
5. GitHub - Version control and portfolio hosting.

## Data Preparation & Cleaning
After generating sample datasets using Mockaroo and Python, I thoroughly reviewed and standardized the data types and values in each table to ensure consistency, quality, and suitability for analysis. Key steps included:
- Converted improperly typed fields (e.g., from "TEXT") to more suitable types such as "VARCHAR", "DATE", "ENUM" etc.
- Reformatted textual date values into proper SQL "DATE" format.
- Cleaned and normalized categorical fields â€” for example, the "gender" column initially contained 9 inconsistent values (due to auto-generated data), which I consolidated into only two valid categories: "Male" and "Female".
- Defined "PRIMARY KEY" and "FOREIGN KEY" constraints to establish strong relationships between tables and enforce referential integrity
- Verified relational consistency across all tables to ensure accurate SQL joins and analysis.

These steps were essential for creating a clean, structured, and analysis-ready database for both SQL querying and Power BI visualization.

## Key Analytical Questions
Here are examples of the analytical questions I answered using SQL:
1. Which students have poor attendance records?
2. Which courses have the highest number of missed classes?
3. How has enrollment (enrollment_year) increased or decreased over the years?
4. What is the academic performance of students with the highest course load?

Each question was solved through an individual SQL query, and the corresponding result was saved as a separate CSV file. All results can be found in the [Questions results](./Questions%20results/) folder.

## Dashboard Previews
Here are a few Power BI visualizations based on SQL outputs:
